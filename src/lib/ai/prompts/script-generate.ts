"${idea}"

OUTPUT LANGUAGE: ${lang}. You MUST write EVERY word of your output in ${lang}, including all section headers, character descriptions, stage directions, and dialogue. Do NOT use English if the language is not English.

**STRICT FORMAT REMINDER** (details are in the system prompt — do not violate):
- Sections 1 (视觉风格) and 2 (角色描述) are machine-readable key:value blocks with fixed Chinese field labels. No markdown, no bullets, no code fences. One field per line.
- Section 3 (场景) is free-form screenplay prose.
- Field labels stay in Chinese verbatim regardless of the output language of the rest of the screenplay.

Content quality:
- Respect user-specified art style if given; otherwise infer the most fitting style from the concept.
- CHARACTERS section must cover every named character with all 5 required fields — downstream AI image generators rely on these to produce consistent visuals.
- Each scene description must be vivid enough for an AI image generator to produce a frame directly.
- Write RICHLY and in DETAIL — every scene needs specific visual descriptions, character actions, emotional beats, and dialogue. Avoid rushing through the story.`;
